Most of the times, when we visit a nice looking website, we always want to look at it's HTML source code. On desktop browsers, we simple just right-click and click on "view page source" from the context menu but there's no option like this on mobile devices. So then, how do we view the source code on a mobile device?

If we are to observe carefully, whenever we click on "view page source" on a desktop browser, it opens a new url in this format `view-source:https://path/to/url`.
If we apply this same trick on a mobile device, it works as expected.

## Steps to view source code

1. Visit the website which you want to view it's source code.

2. Click inside the address bar and append `view-source:` before the url of the website.

3. Click the send button and the page will load with the source code of the file.

**NB:** Even though I used Chrome's mobile browser, the method is the same in all the major browsers.
