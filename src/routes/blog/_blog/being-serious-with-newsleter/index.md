<p class="intro">
    It's really been long since I wrote a newsletter to my subscribers, honestly, I have never written one before evern though my website has one, I guess  I would have to start taking it serious nowadays
</p>

So the main reason why I decided to add a newsletter to my website was because almost every tech blogger was having one the website. I initially started with Sendinblue; then moved away due to it's complicated stuff. I then tried Substack but they didn't have a suitable API so I finally settled with Buttondown, though it's run by one person, it's the best :clap:.

## A promise to myself

So from today, I solemnly promise to be serious with my newsletter, Am kinda reading articles on how to make my newsletter the best. So far, am having about only 17+ subscribers. That's really small but hopefully and willingly, I will grow it. I do subscribe to a couple of newsletters of my fellow tech devs though I prefer RSS to newsletters, RSS is soooo amazing.

## Conclusion

I do hope to get better at writing quality content so from now on, am going to start my newsletter.

Hey!, if you haven't subscribed to my newsletter, [you should do so](https://www.buttondown.email/lucretius).

Have a nice day! :smile:
