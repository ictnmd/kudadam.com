<p class="intro">
	Ever since I started using Svelte, my theme colours has always been flickering on page load. Finally I found a workaround
</p>

## Problem

At first, I was changing my website's theme colour inside the `onMount` function but the theme colours were always flickering. The reason was that, the body loads before the `onMount` function sets the theme colour.
Here's a gif showing the problem

So as you can see, when the page is reloaded, the light theme is first shown, then after the document has finished loading, the `onMount` will then set the theme colour

## Solution

The only probable solution is to set the theme colour before the body has even loaded. How do we do that:question:, we insert a script tag inside the head element and this code will run before the body is loaded. That's the best way we can prevent the flickering of colours.

## The Code

Okay, so you can write this code in the component in which you use to toggle in-between the themes.

```svelte
<svelte:head>
	<script>
		if (document) {
			let mode = localStorage.theme || 'light';
			if (mode === 'dark' || window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches) {
				document.documentElement.classList.add('dark');
				localStorage.theme = 'dark';
			} else {
				document.documentElement.classList.remove('dark');
				localStorage.theme = 'light';
			}
		}
	</script>
</svelte:head>
```

### Explanation

In order to access the head element, we used the `<svelte:head>` component. Then we created the script tag just as we would on our normal HTML pages. The next statements are the important ones, the reason why we used `if (document)` is that, this code first gets evaluated on the server before being rendered on the client, so if you try to access `document` on the server, it will pop up an error.
I know SvelteKit provides the `{ browser }` constant through the `$app/env` module but mind you, this is not available in the custom script tag we made, you will need to use your own workaround and that's why we are using `document` to check.
Then on the next line, we try to retrieve the theme from the `localStorage`, if it's not set, it defaults to "light" theme;
Then the next steps are the addition of classes and setting of the theme in the `localStorage`.

Now look at how the page loads without flickering
