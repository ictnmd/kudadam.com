<p class="intro">
 Whiles trying to implement a read counter for my website this morning, I run into a bug. The function which returned the query from the database always returned <i>undefined</i>
</p>

## The Problem

```javascript
const getData = (slug) => {
	let data;
	db.serialize(() => {
		db.get('SELECT * FROM blog WHERE slug = ?', slug, (err, rows) => {
			data = rows;
		});
	});
	return data;
};

let data = getData('return-data-from-sqlite3-nodejs'); // => undefined
```

This was my code snippet, the function `getData` takes a slug as parameter, then it searches the database to retrieve all the data for the slug. It then assigns the data to the `data` variable, then at the end of the function, it returns the `data` variable. The function without a doubt works perfectly but when you run it, it will always return undefined.

### Why Undefined?

The reason why the function returns undefined is that, `db.get` is an asynchronous function, so the return statement will always run before the function has even completed it's work.

## The Solution

Since the `db.get` function is asynchronous, we need to find a way to make it return it's value once it has finished it's work and the solution is by using [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise). So we need to wrap the whole code in a Promise and when the function finishes executing, the promise will return the results.

### Modified Code

```javascript
const getData = (slug) => {
	return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
		db.serialize(() => {
			db.get('SELECT * FROM blog WHERE slug = ?', slug, (err, rows) => {
				if (err) reject(err);
				resolve(rows);
			});
		});
	});
};

let promise = getData('return-data-from-sqlite3-nodejs') // => Promise { <pending> }
	.then((results) => {
		console.log(results); // => { slug: 'adding-matomo-website', read_times: 1, shares: 0, likes: 0 }
	});
```

### Explanation

So basically, what we did was wrap the whole function in a Promise and pass the `rows` to `resolve` if our code run successfully, else we pass the `err` to `reject` if there were any errors.
