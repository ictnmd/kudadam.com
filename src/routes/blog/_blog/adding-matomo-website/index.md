<p class="intro">
   My <a href="https://clicky.com/">clicky analytics</a> free service was ending today so I decided to move to <a href="https://matomo.org/">Matomo analytics</a>. Matomo analytics has a self-hosted version which is free to use.

So am going to show a pretty easy way to install Matomo analytics on CPanel using the Softaculous application installer.

## Steps To Install

1. Log in to CPanel

   In order to get started, you must first login to your CPanel. The login url is always located at cpanel.yourwebsite.com

2. Locate 'Softcalous Apps Installer' under the Software section of your CPanel and click on it.

3. Search for 'matomo' inside the search bar and click on it

4. Click on Install and fill in the options

   When you click on install, it will show you a form which you are to fill in.

   1. The installation url

      This refers to the location on your website where you want the app to be installed. The recommended protocol is "https://www."

      The domain option is used to select the domain on which the app is to be installed and finally, the directory shows the folder inside your domain where the application will be installed.

   2. The CRON Job

      This feature allows you to set a time to run the Matomo archiving script.

   3. Admin Account

      This allows you to create the user account which you will use to log into Matomo

   4. Advanced Options

      1. Database name

         This refers to the database name which you want Matomo to use to store your data. Remember that the name should not be the name of an existing database.

      2. Table Prefix

         This allows you to set a name which will be prefixed to matomo table names

5. After filling in all the options, click on install.

## Fixing Common Errors

### Cannot Connect To Database Error

If you receive this error, open your file manager and locate the matomo installation folder. Open the config.ini.php file inside the config folder and change the host value to "127.0.0.1".

Close the file and visit the application page again.

## Sign In Error

Just clear your browser cache and you will be good to go.
