<p class="intro">
SvelteKit hooks enable us to do a lot of stuff. Am going to write a little tutorial on how you can create a redirect for your SvelteKit app using <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/hooks">hooks</a>
</p>

Recently, I [wrote an article](understanding-sveltekit-hooks) about how to use SvelteKit hooks. Today, am going to demonstrate a simple example of how you can set a redirect for your app.

The main reason for writing this blog post is to demonstrate how I changed my blog feed URL from "https://www.kudadam.com/blog/feed" to "https://www.kudadm.com/blog/feed.xml". The reason for changing the URL was to make my feeds page more dynamic. JavaScript files which are not given extensions in SvelteKit are compiled during prerendering so the only option I had was to change the URL but I still wanted to keep the old URL working because there were many sites which had my RSS feed in them.

## The Process

So am going to assume you already know how re-directs work. Whenever we are making a redirect, we are normally changing the path for a URL to another URL.

It's like saying if someone is visiting A, send them to B. So in the example, I am going to show how we can redirect a user visiting "/blog/feed" to "/blog/feed.xml".

First of all, open your hooks.js file and paste the following code inside.

```javascript
export const handle = async ({ event, resolve })=>{
  if (event.url.pathname === "/blog/feed"){
â€‹    return Response.redirect(`${event.url.origin}/blog/feed.xml`,301)
  }
  return await resolve(event);
}

```

## Explanation

First of all, we created and exported an asynchronous function called handle. This is required by Svelte as the handle function is run on every request to the server. The function receives an event object and a resolve function. If we are to access the event object, we get the current URL the user is requesting so what we did was a simple if statement. If the user is visiting the URL we want to redirect, then do this else return the standard response.

Now, in the case when the if statement is true, what we do is return a [Response.redirect](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/redirect) to the URL that we want the user to visit. The function takes two parameters, the URL and the status. The status is an optional parameter.

The reason why I used `event.url.origin` before appending the path was to use the same origin the user used to access the site. It isn't compulsory, you could just pop in the full link there and it would work without a problem.

So, fellas, that's a simple way to make a redirect in SvelteKitðŸ˜ƒ
